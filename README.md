# Objective
To create a Deep Learing Model utilizing CNN and Transfer Learning for Dog Breed Classification (Learning Purpose).

# Dataset
Dog Classification datset on Kaggle.

# Methodology:
 1. Utilized concept of Transfer Learning to train the model for dog prediction.
 2. Incorporated image processing techniques to convert the raw images into tensors using NumPy.
 3. Utilized Bactch Processing for training dataset of lenghth 10,000 (approx).
 4. Utilized concept of Early Stopping that prevents extra propagation of bacthes through deep learning layers when
    no significant improvement in evaluation metrics (accuracy) is witnessed.

# Results:
1. Achieved an overall accuracy over 99% for dog breed prediction.

# Tools:
Language: Pyhton.
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit Learn.
Transfer: MobileNet V2.
Domain: Computer Vision
Platform: Google Colab Workspace
